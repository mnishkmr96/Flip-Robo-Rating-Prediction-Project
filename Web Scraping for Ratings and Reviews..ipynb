Laptop comes with 1 Year Dell basic warranty, Genuine Windows 10 which needs to be activated, MS office 2019 student subscription and 15 Months McAfee antivirus subscription. Battery life is good and with moderate use can last upto 5 hrs. Overall a great product if you need laptop for your kid's online classes+homework and not for running Machine learning algorithms.\",\n",
       " 'Best product under 30k. build quility was super as i imagin with dell , good battery backup it will last up to 5-6 hour with heavy use and 7-8 hour with light or modrate ssd speed is also amazing open any application in few seconds , boot time is about 10to12 seconds ,and charging time is about 1.5 hour . i highly recommend this just go for it.',\n",

I used it for daily work and for study.its performance is good because I have installed beam ng and madout bigcity 2 online and it both runs good. On madout bigcity 2 online on faster graphics and full resolution it give 40 to 50 fps that is good . On beam ng which is of compressed 300mb give good performance but it heats to 70 to 80 degree Celsius. But it is not a problem. It is normal when you play a game .i have no issue for it. Also antivirus is pre-installed which is valid upto 10/2022 it prevents me from 1000+ risky connection and 2 viruses. It has ms office pre-installed which is a good thing. Also it takes 5 to 7 second to boot . The keyboard is of premium quality .\\nFirsty i wanted to buy avita essential . Avita is also good but i see reviews where battery is damage after 1 year (avita pura).also it has 4 core 1.1. ghz speed and turbo boost to 3.1 ghz , so it consume less battery , avita essential has celeron processor but it has Pentium silver which is good then celeron. Dell is also a trusted brand . I buy it in 28,090 rs which is good because it normally price goes to 29,990 rs . Screen is good {hd}but better if it is full hd .sound is good. It has 45 wh charger which is good . I can also watch 4k video on YouTube. It works super within any issue, but your internet speed will be good .\\n\\nAlso we can expect this from this price range.i have search on google and they say that dell service is good.\\nIts storage and ram is upgradable.\\nIt is value for money according to me',\n",

       " 'I was looking for a laptop for my kid who needed a device for online school and and to learn programming. I was looking for a laptop with entry level processor with SSD, 8GB ram and 15.6\" display. This one came close. Except for the 8 GB ram, it has everything else. Ram can be upgraded later on.\\n\\nThis laptop is good for:\\n1. All \\'view\\' activities like browsing internet, online shopping, emails etc\\n2. Video calls for online schooling provided you won\\'t use virtual background.\\n3. Basic office documents like Word, Excel and PowerPoint, PDF documents\\n4. Use in a non air-conditioned room as low end processor don\\'t generate too much heat\\n5. Basic software programming\\n6. Watch videos, play music\\n7. Basic multitasking as Windows will take up most of the RAM. I was looking for 8 GB ram for this reason.\\n\\nThis laptop is not good for:\\n1. Gaming as processor is too slow.\\n2. \\'Create\\' activities involving processor intensive tasks such video editing, CAD drawings, graphics, photo editing, animations etc.\\n3. Heavy programming like AI or ML algorithms\\n4. Running lots of background services and utilities that improve user experience but hog the resources\\n5. multitasking when too many programs are running together. If you normally open more than 10 tabs on your browser, you may need more RAM.\\n6. If you need a lot of disk space for large files. This machine as 256GB SSD but you can also add a separate 1TB HDD so this should not be a limitation.\\n\\nFew good points\\nDell power manager allows you to stop charging the battery at 55%. This will extend life of the battery.\\nThin and light, good for portability.\\nHinges appear to be solid.\\nNot a lot of bloatware from Dell. Most of the bloatware can be uninstalled easily.\\nOffice H&S 2019 is available. I don\\'t see any 30 day license note anywhere. Will wait and watch. If it works after 30 days, that\\'s a big plus.\\n\\nFew bad points\\nCamera and display quality is average. With a screen size of 15.6\" and a resolution of 1366x764, sometimes you do see some pixilation. Most of the time, it\\'s just fine.\\n\\nThe only limitation I see is that there is only 1 RAM slot so I have to throw away the 4 Gb chip and replace it with 8 Gb. I generally avoid throwing away working parts but that\\'s the only option I have. 8 GB is also the max the motherboard can handle so once I exceed that I will have to buy a new laptop. It was actually hard to find if other machines with similar specs have 1 slot or 2 slots so I am assuming most machines in this price range comes with one SODIMM slot.',\n",

Ideal for watching movies. It is running Celeron processor which is meant for basic tasks but surprisingly coupled with 256GB SSD, normal tasks such as browsing, reading, document editing with Office feels smooth. But remember it isn't for gaming or heavy tasks. Battery life been great due to power efficient Celeron processor. Earlier I used Core i5 10th gen, although it was powerful but battery life wasn't that great. My usage is light with some browsing, content consumption and editing documents which this laptop serves without breaking a sweat. The fingerprint scanner is nice addition which I find very useful. No need to input pin everytime to unlock. Scanner response is pretty good. Front camera is okay if there's sufficient light in the room as you'd find in this budget.

Charging is good and stays on for much of the time.\\nCon is about the keyboard key placement, no End key or Del key which is very critical for working on Docs and Excel files. for every delete operation, we got to go to the end and press backspace ,which is irritating, also the power key is above the backspace key, and accidentally one can press the power key, which will turn off the laptop.\\noverall it is a decent product for the price range it offers.',\n",

       " \"Updated review after 6months of usage:\\nAll the points mentioned below are same. I bought same laptop one more time for my wife's office usage. Daily usage for me is minimum 10 hours which increases on weekends due to binge watching. Running smooth. Lenovo keeps updating drivers, bios, etc which keeps the system updated. Happy with my decision to buy it.\\nGood product, pricy but it has 11th gen processor which means it is 30% faster then older gen, techies can co relate with it. I have bought it for work from home , I work on virtual cloud and I have found the laptop to be versatile for software development. Display is good but don't expect MacBook type display for movies or online streaming, sound is ok but for zoom meetings it is very much sufficient. I haven't used headset on this laptol so far for meetings, the inbuilt Mike is also powerful, avoids surrounding noise. Keyboard has rich feeling, trackpad could have been better but probably I am comparing apple with oranges. Of course it is not a match to MacBooks trackpad. Best part of thsi laptop is lightening fast shutdown and startup due to addition NVM sata drive where your windows is installed. Lenovo upgrades are very easy , they notify through email for any update. Very well managed on that front. Webcam is very clear. Overall performance is good . This review is after 6 weeks of usage , daily 10 hours minimum. One more point to note is battery performance, My usage is heavy and I g t good 7-8 hours minimum. I still test it every day. And charging is super quick. Here it matches MacBook and in battery life, out petforms MacBook. Not as light and as compact and as sturdy as MacBook but overall the looks are very premium and rich looking. Keyboards are in the race to stand up against the Mac. Windows 10 is also competing very well with Mac in terms of ease of access and this is coming from a person who was Mac user for last 4-5 years. Though it seems pricy when you do comparision with other i5 laptops but then be assured, technically it is at higher place for few things , aethetics and performance fetches the actual browny points. I was sceptical initially but now I feel it was a good decision. my research was fruitful. I will recommend it to software developers.\",\n",
       " \"Loved the laptop. Quick start. Windows 10 /MS Office pre-installed. Finger print access. Privacy shutter for webcam quite useful as a safety measure.\\n\\nMy use is usually MS Office, Zoom, Adobe, web surfing, YouTube, Netflix (at times, if don't want view on TV or mobile), a bit of video editing. My son plays his games hence the graphics card version helps.\\n\\nI usually prefer the SSD + HDD combination, it gives storage space as well as speeds up the programs. On installation of laptop, suggest the user changes default storage paths of documents, images, videos, music and all such files to HDD i.e. D:/ . Laptop default is SSD i.e. C:/\\n\\nSpeakers are quite good, better than many. But I think sound can be better and louder in living room with conversation as well as TV on. They could use technology of the clear, and loud sound of B&O speakers from select HP laptops.\\n\\nWill add to the review after using the laptop more after a few months.\\n\\nWe loved the 1st piece so we bought the same model and configuration 2nd piece for my kid too. I sold my old laptop outside for 19k as Amazon was giving only 10.5k for it (Amazon is still better than Flipkart, where they never take exchange products on some fake pretext.

With continuous video & audio calls, battery lasts for 3-4 hours with full charge.\\n5. Sound output also decent as speakers are on on top.. Just above the keypad.\\n6. Keyboard & touchpad is very good. Keys seem to be quite strong. Backlit keyboard with options of changing the intensity of backlight is helpful.\\n7. As screen is anti glare, hence it is very soothing to eyes.\\n8. Didn't experience any lag or heating issue.\\n\\nWhat i didnt like:\\n1. Web cam quality was average. Was expecting a better quality given the high price laptop. My 8 yr old HP630 has a better web cam.\\n2. The font / text on screen does not come out sharp. Seems bit blurry. Initially i did not notice this but after reading a similar review by another user, this became quite evident. Actually it is. Could be because of the IPS lcd screen.\\n3. The keys of the keypad is almost at the same level of the board i.e. not much raised. So it was bit uncomfortable given that we are used to feel the keys going down when pressed. I think over time one will get used to it.\\n4. My fingers are big and on the thicker side. Had some difficulty in typing as the keys are very near to each other.\\n\\nSo overall i would say it was a pretty good experience except the web cam and the softness of the fonts/text display.\\n\\nWhile buying from Amazon please do check that the invoice and pslip has the laptop serial number mentioned in it. Otherwise Lenovo team will refuse to provide any support. In case you need to get the warranty period corrected, than lenovo team will ask for the invoice with serial number. Lenovo team had agreed to replace the laptop (because of the Bluetooth problem i was facing) but required the invoice with serial number on it.

That actually gives the Ryzen keys better spacing, which I prefer. But all this is personal preference. The 4-zone RGB keyboard is amazing.\\n\\nNow that we have that out of the way, this Omen 15 with the 10th Gen i7-10870H, RTX3060, and 144HZ Refresh Rate is 4.5/5. I have removed 0.5 only because it could have been a bit less costly and for the lack of 1TB SSD.\\n\\nStorage: Average. 4/5\\nWith a 512GB SSD, I must say an additional slot to add another 1TB SSD is given, so if you add 8K INR you could buy a 1TB SSD and get 1.5TB of storage on this laptop, which is very good for the money.\\n\\nThermals: Excellent. 5/5\\nThis laptop has got it right. I have kept the laptop on a simple thin laptop stand without fans. Yes, without fans. And in a room temperature of 21 degree Celsius, it does not heat up on top. The air being blown from the fans below is warm, not hot. What does get hot is the charger, but not hot enough to not be touched. The laptop itself, including the keyboard is excellent and doesn't heat up!\\n\\nFan Noise: 5/5\\nFor everyday work, it is absolutely silent!\\nFor high-performance gaming, the fans come in properly but they aren't obnoxiously loud.\\n\\nBattery Life: Very Good. 4/5\\nIt gets me 6-7 Hours of backup with Chrome, Teams and VPN running on 'Better Battery' setting, when uplugged.\\n\\nGaming Performance: Excellent. 5/5\\nOverwatch: I capped it to 144 Frames. 2 Hours of Gaming and GPU Temp touches 72 Degrees Celsius during demanding battles only, on 'High' Setting'. You must play with the charger plugged-in.\\n\\nForza Horizon 4: 'High' Setting (one less than the max which is Ultra) - 72FPS. No Lag. Awesome Performance.\\nFan Noise does not interrupt the speaker volume/sound.\\n\\nI'm not sure if Microsoft Flight Simulator can run on Ultra (pretty sure there might be some screen tears and lags) but I'm sure it'll run on 'High' settings with over 60FPS (I still haven't tested this out.)\\n\\nOverall Summary: It's a good laptop overall. Buying HP should help with warranty and component replacement in the future if anything goes off, compared to other brands where I'm not sure if the support is as good as HP.\",\n",

Earlier I thought the Optane memory is occupying a second SSD slot but apparently they are using Intel Optane H10 Solid State Drive HBRPEKNX which is a hybrid drive so the second SSD slot is free!\\n5.

Just GTA V is 104 GB in Epic games!\\n\\nOLD REVIEW-\\nOkay, let's talk about the Intel Optane memory here... Which is paired with an SSD.. Really HP? An Optane memory is to be paired with an HDD, an SSD is sufficient in itself! There is no need for the Intel Optane memory, so instead HP could have added an additional SSD and since the Intel Optane memory takes the same slot as an SSD to expand storage with an additional SSD it means to replace the existing Intel Optane Memory. I believe Omen is aimed at gamers and gamers desire performance and Intel Optane memory doesn't increase performance at all!! And then is the meager 512GB SSD! This is like the last nail in the coffin, a gaming machine with a price tag of 1.35 L Indian currency! Really HP? I guess they don't know what is the size of games these days... This is highly unexpected from HP, it's more like intentionally selling Intel hardwares. I am not commenting anything on i7-10870H, AMD competition has better performance but then the intel optane memory... Sounds a tad bit fishy... Anyways I would not recommend to buy this for the current price tag and atleast not since HP hasn't mentioned the TDP of RTX3060 officially, it is rumoured to be 100Watts but it's just a rumour since HP has various configurations with different TDP for similar graphics card. Overall this entire model seems fishy... It's definitely not worth the money!\",\n",

I registered a complaint with the HP customer support and after 4 days, a technician came to my home to fix the laptop. He was unable to fix the laptop and took it with him to the service center. I was told that I will get the laptop in 2 days. But this couldn\\'t have been further from the truth. Over the next one month I have been through this nightmarish experience with HP where they have been completely uncooperative, consistently lied and it has been over 1 month since my laptop stopped working. Here is what happened:-\\n1. They tried replacing the motherboard 3 times (each time it took them weeks to order the parts) and that did not fix the issue. If they are being truthful about this, then they must be phenomenally stupid to do the same thing over and over again and expect different results.\\n2. Every time (23 times over the past 1 month) I call the customer support, after waiting for 20 minutes someone from the HP Premium customer support picks up the call, I narrate the whole incident to them and after that they give the EXACT SAME reply every time \"your case has been elevated\". When I tell them that it has been elevated over a dozen times before this they say that they cannot do anything about this and I will have to wait and I will be contacted by the service center. But I haven\\'t been contacted by the service center even a single time.\\n3. The service center people have never provided me updates by themselves. They rarely pick up calls from me. I CALL THEM 5-6 times every day and if I\\'m lucky they might pick up the call once in 3-4 days. Recently they have completely stopped picking up my calls. To test this, I used a separate phone number to call them and they picked that up. They clearly lied to me by saying that my laptop had been sent to Hyderabad for repair when in reality it had never been sent anywhere (they later told me this themselves).\\n4. According to updated HP policy within 21 days of getting the laptop, we can get a replacement of the product. I was earlier told that MY LAPTOP WAS WITHIN THE REPLACEMENT PERIOD by the HP customer service. I kept pressing for the replacement since it was clear that the service center was unable to fix my laptop and I WAS LOSING VALUABLE TIME (OVER 1 month). But now they did a 180 degree turn and told me that they calculated the replacement period from the DATE OF ORDER and it had been 22 days since the DATE OF ORDER but only 19 days since the DATE OF DELIVERY.\\n\\nI had spent my first Internship stipend money to buy this laptop which I really needed to start working IMMEDIATELY but I have been left in this nightmarish situation where the laptop has been with the service center for the past 1 month and THEY STILL HAVEN\\'T FIGURED OUT WHAT\\'S WRONG WITH THE LAPTOP.

Coming to the keyboard it is one of the best I've ever used. The blue backlit is looks great(would've preferred for an RGB though).\\n\\nThermals and Fans :The thermals were quite good for a laptop around 60k and the fan sound was barely audible even in performance mode.The laptop does get heated while playing AAA games but nothing much to be worried about.\\n\\nPerformance: The AMD Ryzen 5 core works like a charm, it gives intel i7 10th gen a run for its money.The boot up time is around 4-6 sec with the SSD.All the FPS games ran pretty smoothly even with ultra settings.\\n\\nOthers: The Lenovo Vantage software is a plus and so is the privacy shutter(which I think every laptop should have by the way)\\n\\nCons:\\nDisplay: Nothing great to be excited about here. Both the brightness and color accuracy of the screen are average.\\n\\nBattery: Okay so I see Lenovo changed their stance on battery life from 6.7 hrs to 5 which is more accurate . While gaming the battery lasted for about 90 min.During normal usage it lasts for 3.5 - 4 hrs, although it did last for 5 hrs when the settings were under Quiet mode.\\n\\nSpeakers: The speakers were okay and I expected nothing more from a laptop of this price range(I mostly use headphones anyway).\\n\\nSo to conclude this just might be one of the best gaming laptop under 65k if not the best and you could totally go for it.\",\n",

CAMERA: One grate thing about camera is they give Privacy shutter feature through which u can lock your camera. A good camera security feature.Camera quality is not good.It\\'s worst. It gives too much pixalated images.You can record video upto 720p 30fps. It is better to purchase external camera if you are a creator/Live streamer.\\n\\n3. KEYBOARD: It is full size keyboard. Key design and the quality is awesome. This keyboard design wil helps to comfort and accurate typing. Key movement is also good. It has two modes of backlight(BLUE color). The blue colored key light feels like premium. One important thing is, You should always take care(clean) of keybord, Any dust and stones kind of small particles will easely enter below the keys and may cause problems when typing. Always clean keyboard before using it.\\n\\n4. BATTERY: Battery life is decent.

It\\'s a good laptop, don\\'t get me wrong, but\\n\\n1. if you\\'re expecting the advertised battery performance, then you will be disappointed - immensely. I get at most an hour, which to my requirement is good enough. I always look for power source nearby, and if there is none, I try to limit my electronic (phone, laptops etc) usage. It\\'s all right with me, but maybe not with you.\\n\\n2. if you\\'re expecting a \"premium\" support, as advertised, then you will be disappointed again. Exactly the day AFTER my return window with Amazon ended, I found out that the number 5 on the right-side number pad gets stuck. ONE day! A conglomerate like Amazon should be in a place to make exceptions, but it\\'s all right, I was still within Lenovo\\'s warranty, and because of that, I was asked by the Amazon representative to contact them - and I did. By bad support, I am not talking about the support I got from Amazon - this guy was just following standard protocol - it\\'s Lenovo\\'s! The same day, I raised a ticket with them, and it\\'s been a week now, and I haven\\'t gotten ANY call/email/message from them. Now I hear you ask, \"But doood. If you haven\\'t gotten any email or message, the complaint wouldn\\'t have gone through or registered\", to which I say, I see the ticket number when I go to the Lenovo portal, and it\\'s in \"Investigating\" status (or something like that). You get the point. ONE WEEK of premium support (or lack thereof)!\\n\\n**UPDATE** - Lenovo finally acknowledged the request and some 8 - 9 tos-and-fros later, agreed to send a technician, who found out the issue is real and agreed for a replacement (Obviously it wasn\\'t all this simple - this whole process took him about 2 hours). FYI, as on this writing, the replacement is yet to arrive (and the laptop is sealed in a Lenovo branded cover with its carton box - post Covid-19 procedure I suppose - and is in my custody). And that\\'s 2 days without laptop- Just saying :/\\n\\n3. if you expect to play a lot of newer games - I haven\\'t tried this personally, and I bought this laptop not (entirely) for gaming (although I had installed CoD Ghosts (I know it\\'s an old game), and after like an hour into the game, it glitched on me once - at a place when there was a huge explosion, maybe the graphics card couldn\\'t process that much info) but I must say it\\'s been a good performer. I ran my DL (deep learning) model with over 1 crore rows, and about 17 columns and it performed better than my work laptop, which has (only) a 16 gb RAM, no external graphic card. I will upgrade the RAM on this to 16 (it\\'s 8*1 now and I will add another equivalent 8 (3200/CL-22)) and see how it goes, but all that after I get the issue at hand sorted out.\\n\\nBTW, the reason I realized my keyboard had an issue late was because I use a Bluetooth keyboard and the only time I used its own keyboard was in its first day, and somehow I forgot to test the keyboard.\\n\\nFYI, it\\'s a fingerprint magnet.',\n",

Use in a non air-conditioned room as low end processor don\\'t generate too much heat\\n5. Basic software programming\\n6. Watch videos, play music\\n7. Basic multitasking as Windows will take up most of the RAM. I was looking for 8 GB ram for this reason.\\n\\nThis laptop is not good for:\\n1.

Heavy programming like AI or ML algorithms\\n4.

Most of the time, it\\'s just fine.\\n\\nThe only limitation I see is that there is only 1 RAM slot so I have to throw away the 4 Gb chip and replace it with 8 Gb. I generally avoid throwing away working parts but that\\'s the only option I have. 8 GB is also the max the motherboard can handle so once I exceed that I will have to buy a new laptop.

Reported to Asus and a technician visited home and changed the hard drive without even turning it in and checking the performance. Nothing changed after that. Raised a subsequent complaint and they took the laptop to the service center and returned after a couple of days. The laptop became slightly faster and boots up in a minute. They informed me it was a software issue. However, compared to my 10 year old desktop with 4gb RAM, this laptop is still slower. Checked with a computer service personnel. He said any laptop with hard drive with windows 10 (especially with recent updates) would be slower and asked me to switch to a NVMe SSD which would improve performance. He also mentioned he has been changing a lot of HDDs to SSD because of this. I might try that. Also the laptop has only a single slot for RAM and a single slot for NVMe SSD. So adding an other RAM of similar capacity is out of the question. If anyone has similar issues, please raise a complaint with Asus and perhaps yours too would improve a bit. It is still unacceptable to even sell such a poor performance laptop for today's basic needs too. Once I change to NVMe SSD will update the review.\\nReview after few months of usage.....The problem of slow booting and overall extremely slow performance persisted until I upgraded it with a NVME M.2 Kingston A2000 SSD 250gb (cost effective one). The laptop is no longer slow and boots up within 20 seconds or less and shuts down in about a few seconds. So I would recommend those who bought this frustrating laptop may upgrade this way.

       " \"I wanted to buy a laptop and my main purpose was fast processor, occasional photo and video editing, good overall design and longevity. This will look something like minimum 4 core processors with up to 4 GHz, 500 GB SSD, 16 GB RAM, min. 4 GB graphics card. Other preferences were that the laptop should be less than 2 Kg, has decent thermals, good audio and mic for video calls and battery life of at least 4 hours on normal usage and easy to carry design. My budget was limited, so I definitely couldn't afford i7 10th gen laptops which cost more than a lakh. In my budget of 60k, I had just two options- Ryzen 5 4600H or Intel i5 9th generations.\\n\\nI read lots of reviews, watched a lot of youtube unboxing videos, and visited nearby stores also to check hands-on. And my conclusions are as follows:\\n\\nRyzen 5 4600 H is much ahead of Intel i5 10th generation and matches upto intel i7 10th gen in some areas. The reason is 7 nm architecture and 2 additional cores, better thermals and more efficiency in utilizing RAMs. These processors are so popular and in demand that since June, the laptops listed on Amazon and Flipkart started getting out of stock within a few hours of being listed. So, my best bet was definitely Ryzen 5 4600H over any other processor.\\n\\nIn August, HP launched Pavilion Gaming laptop with Ryzen 5 4600H laptops with Nvidia GTX 1650 4 GB graphics card on Amazon which was listed at a price of 60,990 but with 1 TB 5200 RPM and 8 GB 2666 MHz RAM. The laptop had many complaints of slow boot speed, but that's because of the 5200 rpm HDD. At Least they should have provided 7200 rpm HDD with such high specs. This meant, we definitely had to invest in a M.2 NVME SSD of 500 GB to utilize the processor speed which would cost me approx. 6-7K. That laptop is currently available at 65k on Amazon.\\n\\nIn a couple of weeks, HP launched a slightly upgraded version of the Pavilion Gaming laptop with same specs but with 512 GB NVME SSD, 1650Ti 4 GB graphics card and 144 Hz LCD screen at 70,990 but the price was later increased to Rs 71,999. In a few days another variant was launched at slightly increased price with 1 TB HDD and 256 GB SSD. The HP Omen laptop os similar configuration is also available in similar specs but with 60Hz screen in between 76-81k online.\\n\\nHowever, Asus Tuf A15 with Ryzen 5 4600h, 144 Hz screen and 512 GB SSD was again back in stock the next day and provided exactly the same specs to the Hp pavilion gaming laptop of 72k but at least `10k cheaper. Another benefit Asus Tuf A15 gave was upgradability of RAm upto 32 GB compared to 16 GB in Pavillion. The laptop was out of stock within a couple of hours. But, what attracted me was the availability of the Ryzen 7 4800H within 76K which is actually a steal. However, I went with HP Pavilion Gaming with Ryzen 5 4600H, 512 GB SSD with 144 HZ screen over Asus Tuf A15.\\n\\nIn my next section I am going to explain what made me buy HP Pavilion instead of Asus TUF A15 despite the big price difference.\\n\\nAsus Tuf A15 is undeniably the most value for money at least for gaming enthusiasts, but my purpose here is not just gaming but also using the laptop for work as well as content creation. I am a heavy user and normally use my laptop 7-8 hours a day working. When I went through all reviews available on Amazon as well as many youtube videos made in India and abroad- I came across at least 3 issues in Asus Tuf A15.\\n\\nBuild quality:\\nThough Asus claims Tuf A15 has military grade design, the reviews and my own hands on experience in Asus store clearly showed that the plastic quality in and around the keyboard is very cheap and can be pressed easily. There are also problems with the quality of hinges which I think is common with most low and mid range Asus laptops. Same with the lid. There are lots of youtube videos where you can see people complaining about the delicate lid and keyboard base. This issue may be ignored if you look at the price. But...certainly this will affect the user experience and most importantly the joy of using the laptop.\\n\\nScreen:\\nBoth Hp and Asus come with 144 Hz FHD IPS LCD displays. None of the displays are great for content creators due to 45% NTSC. One common complaint in both of the laptops is their poor brightness and colour gamut. However, if you do comparison, Asus’s screen quality lags slightly behind in terms of saturation and colour reproduction. Though the difference is not very significant, HP’s screen edges out the Asus by a margin in terms of colour reproduction, while Asus’s brightness is marginally better than HP. This is my personal observation and you can also google about this. I only expect that the laptop companies should provide an option of going with a 60 fps screen with better colour gamut for content creators rather forcing us with 144 Hz screen with poor colour gamut.\\n\\nThermal and fan noise:\\nAlmost all users of Asus Tuf A15 agree that thermals are poorly designed because of which GPU and CPU gets too hot reaching up to 95 degrees as per some reviews. . I am not going too deep into it, as you can yourself google it. The main reason is the placement of the fans away from the processor and the poor ventilation design. Due to the design flaw, Asus has put powerful fans to pull and push air through the small vents. This had again two effects- heating of the body which is of not great quality plastic and load on the cooling fan which has to constantly run at high rpms. The 2nd turn off in Asus Tuf A15 is the fan noise. Almost all reviews of TufA15 complain about the fan noise. However, the high temperatures may not have a significant impact on processor performance and the system will work fine. But upgrading memory later may alter the thermal dynamics and one may need to be very careful while tinkering with this laptop. Though the heating and noise is within acceptable limits, it does cause distraction while working. Also, Tuf A15 being approx 350g heavier alongwith hot air coming out with noisy fans may prevent you from using the notebook on your lap or using it for longer durations. Compared to Asus tuf A15- HP Pavilion thermal are much much better and there is hardly any noise coming out. There is ample ventilation given below and to the back which is powered by two fans which is placed just above the processor. It is perfect for long work, and you can place it on your lap without worrying about the heat and noise.\\n\\nBattery:\\nAsus Tuf A15 comes with 48 WH 3-cell battery while HP comes with 52 WH 3-cell battery. However, the average backup time in both the laptops varies significantly. While Asus claims 6 hours, HP claims 8 hours backup. I have used the HP laptop for 6 hours straight surfing the web and working on MS Word. People who use Asus claim to reach around 5 hours. HP has clearly an advantage over Asus in this segment because of better power management, much of which owes to better thermal management.\\n\\nSound:\\nThe Bang & Olufsen speakers in HP Pavilion are much much ahead of the in-built speakers in Asus Tuf A-15 in terms of clarity and loudness. HP Pavilion also comes with dual microphones which are placed just alongside the camera. On the other hand, Asus provides DTX Ultra 7.1 sound drivers which you can connect to your home theater or headphone. In my opinion, having good quality speakers is much better in a laptop than having a driver to use in an external speaker. In this segment, HP is the clear winner.\\n\\nDesign:\\nHP is known for design which caters to working professionals and Asus is known for innovation and caters to youth and gamers. This can be visible in these two models. HP Pavilion is lightweight just below >2 Kg compared to Asus Tuf A15 which weighs 2.30 Kg. Over that the design of HP is targeted towards content creators and the plastic quality doesn't feel cheap and the laptop itself is quite sturdy. Asus on the other hand feels cheap and the plastic quality is just okay. The keyboard of HP pavilion is white single colour with 2 brightness level and raised keys, while Asus has multi color RGB keyboard with highlighted transparent keys W-ASD keys which gives it a gaming look. The keys in both of these laptops are of good quality but provide different user experiences. Personally, I liked the keyboard layout of hp better for working professionals compared to Asus which is made primarily keeping the gamers in mind. The touchpad in Hp is single body design, while Asus has provided separate right and left buttons. The placement of speakers in honeycomb design just above the keyboard is certainly better than Asus and also adds to the premium look. The V-shaped joint between the keyboard and the screen looks much better than the 2 single hinges of Asus Tuf A 15.\\n\\nMy Conclusion:\\n\\nBoth Asus Tuf A15 and HP Pavilion Gaming are value for money laptops but designed entirely for two different segments of user. If you are working professional, who wants a feature-rich, reliable, silent, sturdy and have a laptop experience-then go for HP Pavilion which is slightly expensive but that is worth the price. If you are a heavy gamer or tight in budget- then Asus Tuf A15 and prefers specifications over features- then Asus Tuf A15 is the best choice.\",\n",

Its still as good as new. I did research for 6 months after checking its competitors who dont provide 1650 TI + 144 hz screen + B.O speakers at the same price point i.e. Lenevo (its shabby looking).. DELL(blue lit keyboard).. ASUS (too heavy). NONE can hold a candle to it. KUDOS to HP.',\n",
       " \"This laptop is absolutely the best you could get for under 75k. 1650ti gives you a great gaming experience, whereas the 144hz screen supports it well. It is the only gaming laptop in this price segment which comes with a 144hz screen and it doesn't disappoint. The SSD is pretty quick as well. The keyboard is also really good. The trackpad could've been a bit bigger, but is still okayish. The only drawback I've noticed in my use of one week is the port selection. It is pretty poor, consisting of only ONE USB 3.0, one USB 2 and one USB C, so you have to use a USB 3.0 hub. Recommended for casual gamers who crave for a 144hz experience\",\n",

After these updates the screen started to flicker and i couldn\\'t open games such as GTA V. It gave me a scare . Researched online about this issue in HP website. The solution was to put the laptop in recovery mode, uninstall the display drivers ( both amd and nvidia) , restart then again update the drivers. ( Note: Install amd drivers manually from amd website and nvidia drivers manually instead of updating them from windows update) This manuever gave me a big scare as this is a costly machine (atleast for me). But everything is sorted out now.\\nFor the review now:\\n*Display is good after the above mentioned altercations I did.\\n*Trackpad could have been better.\\n*Could play all the AAA titles just fine, no hiccups there.\\n* Battery performance is good.\\n* Speakers are mediocre ( come on it\\'s a gaming machine)\\n*Thermal performance is good.\\n*Webcam quality is bad.\\n\"Overall a good laptop.

So cribbing about bad thermals makes no sense. Those who feel they need better thermals should probably go in for a desktop or pay the price for a premium laptop.

It has only 2 USB type A ports, so if you're planning on connecting a keyboard and mouse and another pendrive, you will need a usb hub.

It lasts for about 4 hours on battery on normal usage (not gaming). Thermals are good, though I would recommend using ryzen controller application for long gaming sessions.

       " \"I've been using it for sometime now and here are my thoughts\\n\\nDisplay - Display quality is on par with the Nitros and Legions at this price. The display is okay for indoor usage unless you're sitting in an insanely bright room, coz the display doesn't get very bright and you'd have trouble. One thing I didn't like is the hinge. It wobbles and over time when the hinge loses strength, it could be a problem. But again depends on how you take care of the laptop.\\n\\nPerformance - Performance is really good. I only tried GTA V on very high graphics setting and easily got 60+ fps, gameplay was smooth and no hiccups anywhere. Laptop boots up in literally 2-3 seconds. Normal day to day is a breeze thanks to Ryzen 5 5600h. Fan noise is bearable, not too loud. Thermals on this device is really well done, doesn't heat up much even after extended hours of gaming (gta v).\\n\\nBuild Quality - There is top lid flex and very little keyboard flex. But the quality of plastic used is really good. It's not as premium feeling as Legion but better or equivalent to the Nitro series I feel. It's got a really big trackpad and you can hear the clicks when you press on it.\\n\\nBattery Life - You can't really expect much battery life from a gaming laptop, I got somewhere around 2.5 -3 hours (not on battery saver mode) and I guess that's okayish.\\n\\nSpeakers - Speakers are loud and decent. There is distortion on high volumes. It's not as good as legion though. If you're gamer you're obviously gonna get nice headphones, so yeah. Speakers are good, not great.\\n\\nSO far it's really great and i really enjoy using it. Things lacking is a higher refresh rate and higher storage options. If you can look past that go for it!\",\n",

While gaming better to plug in.Good battery for a gaming laptop\\nRAM and ROM : excellent read write speeds and boots up quickly within 2 sec.\\nMuch faster in daily usage.\\nExtra benefit: Hp omen hub, Quick drop, assistant support, Alexa inbuilt, office 365 these are some amazing features that you get in this laptop.\\n\\nIn short, this is the best under 75k just go for it!!!!',\n",

I don't think one should compromise on screen as you look at it all the time you are using the laptop. 165hz is overkill. Haven't tested a Dolby Vision Video, but even in normal videos, colors are vivid and look great. And the screen has DC dimmer. If you use your laptop in low brightness (like less than 50%) then many laptop screens use PWM to dim the screen which is very damaging for your eyes. This laptop has DC dimmer and you won't feel much eye strain even after using it for a long time.\\n2. Ryzen 5800h is extremely efficient, compared to Intel 11800h. For regular use, you won't feel any difference.\\n3. Keyboard feels amazing to type on.\\n4. Battery is 80Whr, can last 7ish hours for normal use using all battery saver option. Though it has battery conservation mode with limits the charging to 60% and can drastically increase the overall battery lifespan. Really useful if you are to plug it in all the time.\\n5. It got MUX switch, so you can take all the advantages of the GPU.\\n6. The cooling is perfect. I have disabled the CPU turbo using registry and all the games I have tested the CPU does not go over 65C. The GPU stays within 75C. Also, the fans are not that noisy in Balanced mode. Also the CPU and GPU idles at 30-35C. You can get the CPU and GPU at run at 50 C around using NVIDIA Whisper Mode and Disabling Processor Boost.\\n7. You get MS Office pre-installed.\\n8. Ports at the back make for a really clean look.\\n9. A very solid build quality. Its like a tank among laptops.\\nCons.\\n1. Unless you get it at sale price, it is not value for money.\\n2. The pre-installed ssd get heated till 50C and idles at 40C. I have installed another SSD for games but it doesn't heat up as much.\\n3. The warranty you get out of the box is 1 year onsite and 1 year depot. I have mailed regarding upgrading warranty as is provided in the Amazon Page but the same has not been updated yet. Will change this if the status is updated.\\nUpdate- It has been a pain updating the pre-bundled warranty. It has been 14 days or repeated calls mails and escalations but the same has not been updated even if they tell you they will update it in 2 days. I don't have high hopes regarding after sales service from Lenovo now. I would say product is excellent, but the service is pathetic. Will update if this is resolved.\\nUpdate 2- The warranty has been updated, and with this I would say it deserves to get back a star. Still deducting one for the hassle.\",\n",

Editing upto 4k videos is just butter smooth, renders in real time and does it all without hiccups. Battery life is great for general use, 8 hrs+ life on mix usage like web browsing, binge watching, music over blue tooth, graphic design etc. I felt the only time battery drains faster is when it uses the dedicated gpu and i don't mean in games, da vinci resolve or premiere pro like resource hogging softwares will drain it in 2-3 hrs. Although you could go to the armory crate and check the igpu mode which will only use integrated gpu for longer battery life, really depends on you.

       " \"This is a great compact laptop for someone who wants to do a little bit of everything (video games, surfing, photo/video editing etc.).\\n\\nDisplay: Full HD 16:9 IPS panel which supports fast 144hz refresh rate (makes everything feel snappy). Is fairly color accurate (but can't match a MacBook for sure) and is bright enough. Thought the screen is matte, the moonlight (silver) varient does cast some light on it which is distracting (unless you push the screen to its extreme - the way it is supposed to be).\\n\\nSpeakers: Is loud and punchy. Can't match a MacBook, but is far better than usual Windows based laptops. Has two top firing speakers as well, so your audio doesn't get muffled if you keep this on a bed/couch etc.\\n\\nKeyboard and trackpad: Keyboard is big and spaced out. Has good tactile feedback and is backlit (although unevenly - again something you wouldn't notice on a dim room). Trackpad feels very good but is quite small (the Macbook's feels like an XL when compared to this one).\\n\\nBuild quality & finish: Really good and is on par with other premium Windows laptops. Can easily open this for any upgrades (storage, RAM) without breaking any clips. Feels well put together and repairable. The lid is white with perforations - no Anime Matrix though.\\n\\nPort Selection: Everything you need except an ethernet port and SD card reader. Thunderbolt ofcourse is missing since this an AMD based config. But you can charge via USB C (if your laptop has more than 5% charge to begin with) and connect to display port.\\n\\nGaming and Graphics card: Runs most current gen games on medium to high with decent frame rate in Full HD resolution. Isn't future proof though, and will struggle once developers create games to take full advantage of next gen stuff. Doesn't support ray tracing. Also doesn't have any AI acceleration that comes with RTX cards (used by Adobe and lot of creative softwares too now). This is the Achilles heel for this varient of G14.\\n\\nHeat & Fan Sound: Doesn't heat up that much while doing regular stuff (office, browsing, videoes) and the fan rarely kicks in. On gaming and under heavy loads it does get warm and noisy. But for the package under the hood, it's quite good.\\n\\nAccessories: Sleeve and charger (150w).\\n\\nSoftware: McAfee (1 Year), Office Home & Student (Licenced - not Trial), Xbox 1 month game pass.\\n\\nRecommended upgrades: Add an 8GB RAM to the empty slot to make a total of 16GB RAM\\n\\nFinal thoughts: Chose this over a similarly priced M1 Air - 256, 8GB model. Quite happy with the choice and no regrets. Pros: Upgradable and repairable, can game on this a bit, doesn't lock you in an ecosystem.\\n\\nCompared to a regular gaming laptop this is lighter, feels premium and offers you more battery backup, has a nicer screen, speakers and trackpad. If gaming is not your main priority, this will serve you well.\\n\\nCons: Chin (bottom bezel), smaller trackpad, no webcam (has software to use your phone camera as a webcam - just in case), a graphics card that isn't future proof.\",\n",

My preliminary views are as under:\\n\\n1) Battery Life - this is the best gaming laptop in terms of battery life. 70WHR battery last for 8 hours on normal use and 5 hours on gaming which is best out of all. So will give 5 out of 5\\n\\n2) screen - the laptop screen is good for use at home and not outside. 250 nite brightness is not good for using it outside. Further, 60Hz screen is not apt for proper gaming, it will give less FPS. All other players are giving min 120 hz in this price range. So will give 3 out of 5.\\n\\n3. GAMING - Have played games in medium settings. Worked fine. But it get heated much, so need to improve on thermals. Graphic card GTX 1650 works well. Also 60 hz panel. So will give 3 out of 5\\n\\n4. MS office - Best part of this laptop is free lifetime ms office 2019. No gaming laptop in this price range give this. So will give 5 out of 5.\\n\\n5. Weight and Looks - This weights almost 2.5 kgs which is really high, I guess due to battery. Looks give office feeling and not gaming feeling which is good for me.\\n\\n6. Built quality - Built is ok. As most reviewers said, screen wobbles even with fan operation. Fully plastic and hinges are not strong. Still you will have no problem in working with it. So will give 3 out of 5.\\n\\n7. Sound Quality - The sound quality is ok types for gaming laptop. The sound is not too great and you will have to use headphones for gaming as well as movie streaming. So will give 3 out of 5.\\n\\n8. Conclusion - in totality, I will give 4 out of 5. For those who want to use it for office work, playing medium setting gamew, this is best in price and features. Not for hard-core gamers. For gaming, buy HP Pavillion 5600H with same price with 144 Hz screen.',\n",

I have not done gaming much on this laptop but yeah I am sure it would definitely give around 3-3.5 hours of backup.\\n2) Display : Seamless display. Although this does not have a 144Hz panel, it does not bother much unless you are a hardcore gamer and FPS matters to you more than your life(just kidding). Display is great.\\n3) Heating : Let's just box it and keep it aside. Although the visuals show 5 way cooling(which is there in the 3060 model only) the cooling in this is apt for the tasks which I mentioned above.\\n4) Build : Although the full body is plastic, it's feels and looks quite premium and the plastic used is of good quality.\\n5) Overall Performance : Trust me you can go for it without a doubt.\\n\\nCons :\\n1) Weight : The weight is a whopping 2.5kgs which is a problem for carrying around but if you don't move much. It would not be an issue\\n2) Performance (For Hardcore Gamers) : You do not get the performance mode for gaming as the above models do as the performance mode requires more power i.e. the 200w brick but in this you get only the 150w brick.\\n\\nWell as the rating suggests this is much above than good and slightly below perfect as nothing is perfect.

       " \"First of all there's no doubt that the product is cool and awesome but something I would like to share is that this product can give you problems with one very basic thing... The BIOS ... Be very careful with the bios and know that this laptop does not have a separate cmos battery on the motherboard so if you disconnect the main battery while doing upgrade of any kind the CMOS will reset. And Becareful with updating the BIOS software from windows always use windows 20H2 version . Donot upgrade to windows 21H1 before doing bios update. My laptop unit failed the update due to this and now is in coma. HP is not very helpful and fast with their service so it's more than 2 weeks now that they haven't sent the new replacement motherboard yet. Its really sad that brands like HP hode this kind of things. Before update or upgrade make sure you know everything about the product.

For a normal user the display is crisp and punchy.\\n2)performance is top notch for 1080p gaming i get 144fps constant while plugged in valorant (this is the only videogame i play.)\\n3) battery is above average i got around 3-4 hrs of screen onn time with normal use and 1.5-2 hrs wits gaming depending on graphical settings. I recommend to play games while plugged in.\\n4) boot time is really fast. Laptop boots within 6 secs most of the time. Thanks to ssd.\\n5)The design of this laptop is really catchy but at the same time it doesn't scream gaming. To be precise its balanced design.\\n6) There are all the ports you will need on the laptop.\\n7)The rgb keyboard cherry on the cake. This is also not present in any laptop in this price range.\\n8)the my asus feature on this laptop is really convinient to wirelessly transfer files from phone to laptop. And its really fast.\\n\\nCons-\\n1) Due to rgb keyboard and 144hz display the storage option on this perticular model is 512gb and for higher storage option u have to go for the more expensive varient.\\n2)The storage here is 512gb but after all the windows installation and bloatware from both asus and microsoft we are left wits around 418gb which may seem a lot but isn't enough for a power user like me.\\n3)Asus's armoury crate in this laptop is pretty much useless as there aren't many customisation options available.there are only performance customisation which i think also customise the fan speed and rgb customisation which include only 4 options as its one zone rgb keyboard.\\n4) camera on this laptop is straight up trash though it claims to be 720p but the video is really grainy even in good light.\\n5)this may be nitpicking but asus claim this laptop to be military grade durable and i doubt that as there is flex in deck as well as screen.\",\n",

There\\'s no MS subscription but there\\'s a one month xbox game pass.The boot up time is around 3-4 secs. i5 10th gen with 1650 is good, although 1650Ti or 1660Ti would\\'ve been better. But I suppose they can\\'t sell laptops with such GPUs for 62k. The backlit keyboard is awesome too.The battery is okay.',\n",
       " \"I have used this laptop for almost a week now.I found many pro's as well as cons while using this laptop.First the pros..I tested many games like Assassin's Creed Valhalla,Watch Dogs 2,Destiny 2.No problem whatsoever while gaming.Really good fps in older games like Destiny 2 and Watch Dogs 2,and decent fps in newer titles like AC Valhalla.Some setting tweak and it is possible to get almost 60 fps in Valhalla.The 144hz screen is really great,everything feels smooth tho i wont use it cause the screen is too small.I connected the laptop using hdmi to a monitor.The rgb keyboard is a nice touch.Overall it does what it is good at i.e,gaming.\\n\\nNow for the cons..this laptop gets waaay too loud while gaming.I use headphones and i can still listen to the noise if the volume is low.I was using a PC before so i havent experienced this kind of sound.Now comes the battery backup which is absolutely pathetic.U can barely use this laptop for 1 hour 30 mins while doing normal stuff.The backup is very bad.The other problems i faced is that the adapter gets waaay too hot and i mean it,way too hot while gaming.I plugged it in for 3 hours while gaming and it gets so hot that i almost couldn't touch it.I have to stop between my gaming sessions and unplug the charger for it to cool down which is very frustrating since i was using a PC before and never had to face this kind of problem.Now comes the camera.The camera is...bad,just bad.I would never use it for anything,i would rather use my phone camera for meetings and other stuff.\\n\\nSo in conclusion this laptop is good for gaming while plugged in,but for watching movies with backup power,its not great and u can watch only a 2hour movie at most.I would give this laptop a 7/10.\",\n",

Would highly recommend the same with ryzen 7 4800 and this one too if budget is upto 60k Grey colur metallic top looks dope.

The thermals of this thing are heavily compromised. The CPU easily reaches 95°C even under medium-heavy loads. So if you sit nearby an AC, you should be fine. And thanks to intel you cannot Undervolt the CPU. The only thing you can do to run the CPU under 90 degrees is to limit the TDP using any 3rd-party software or limit the Turbo Freq. within windows power settings.\\nBut once you do that, it should perform quite good in most cases even though it costs you a few frames.\\nOverall a nice 7.5 out of 10 and 9 if they had better cooling.',\n",

So very less compared to my old Acer laptop.\\n3. Customer service: Make a call to customer service and get links to resolve the problem, but the link sent by the authority is not applicable for this laptop, even its very difficult to get the same brochure in youtube videos, don't know why lots of customization Asus have made to make any search. Even in the FAQ session of Asus, you can't get how can you actually resolve the problem, because all manuals are changed in the case of this laptop.\\n4. Bluetooth: playing a song with any Bluetooth device, then if you stop the connected device and again start, it will connect with your laptop, but now the sound starts to crack.

We can also add an M.2 ssd or a 2.5 inch HDD or Sata SSD (*with included sata cable). I won't recommend using the laptop keyboard for gaming as it might not last for long period. For typing it is decent. A decent amount of port selection is appreciated. Laptop speakers are just okay and you can change to different modes in Dts:X app. The Hinge is stiff with minimal screen flex. The Screen bends upto 120° I think so.

I have a feeling that this laptop was a refurbished piece which was put together and just put up for sale on Amazon.\\n\\nI have posted pictures of the current state of this laptop so that others can be saved from such an horrid experience.',\n",
       " 'Didn’t receive any mouse which was promised earlier in the partner offers section',\n",
       " 'Its a very delicate product, cheap plastic body and keypad are worst. The hinges are on the rising side so any or little pressure and they broke within 2 weeks from purchase and cost of replacement is 7k. so not worth it.',\n",
       " 'Once you purchased a any product from online you will never be changed the product in very simple way (apko 50 bar mail or phone karha padega). I have investe more money which I have in capacity, thereafter my problem not resolved by anyone. Please help me',\n",
       " \"This is very unlike Dell , this model has serious design issue , left screen is locked and can't open the screen .\\nQuedtion mark on Dell service,Complaint reported on 26th Oct till date not resolved as the part is not available?\\nDon't choose blindly Dell\",\n",
       " \"Serious Design Flaw hinges broken with in one month. I am traped in newly launched model of dell inspiron 3511. Dell is number 1 laptop and is known for his durability but this model is realy very pathetic. I purchased this laptop only considering the hinges design which lift the laftop when laptop lid is open. That time I was not aware that this is the biggest problem of this model. Don't buy this laptop if you are going to spent your hard earned money. Please see other brands and models. Don't have less than 1 star otherwise I would have given zero.\",\n",

       " 'Dell is always my first preference for windows laptops. This model is feature rich and is a best choice under 40k. No heating issues , great battery life and sleek and stylish makes it best model in this category.',\n",

       " \"Don't go for dell, they sell stones. High price no quality and support. They ask for money even in gurantee period.\",\n",

       " \"Just received this beauty. Looks good. Build quality is too good. Except for the camera quality, this one rocks in terms performance. It's the highest performance we could expect from a low end laptop. FHD Display is very good, too. In a nutshell, it offers pretty much we could ask for, at 34500. I haven't found any flaws, that the users reported, yet. I can say, it's free of flaws. If you're looking to purchase a low end laptop, you can just go for it!!!\\n\\nIf you face any issues(like the ones, the other users reported), just update the critical or recommended BIOS(firmware/hardware) thru Lenovo Vantage app and OS(Software) thru System settings.\\n\\nIt offered Windows 11, right away after booting the system up. It's an option. You can opt to stay in Windows 10, if you wish to remain with stable OS. You won't receive Windows 11 update in System updates(as of now).\\n\\ni3 10th gen(10110) + SSD🔥\\n\\nSeller: Appario Retail Pvt Ltd.\\nPrice: 34490[35990-1500(Credit card offer)]\\nCombo offer: 35990(Laptop)+200(Lenovo 2 sleeve bag)-1500(CC offer)=34690\\n\\nUpdate: Unlike HP or Acer PCs, when the brightness is decreased to 0, the screen behaves like it went off. Yep, the screen will be on and the programs too, but it's like the screen is dead or PC's switched off. We'll just have to increase the brightness. That's the catch. I actually freaked out when this happened to me. I accidentally reduced brightness to 0 without even knowing. I thought the screen was dead as other users reported this, too. Then I tried increasing brightness. Bingo!\\n\\nUpdate: Been using it for 15 days, haven't found any flaws, yet. The only issue is that when the laptop is flipped out open, It boots up automatically. We can stop that from doing so. I'm fine with it, though.\",\n",
